# Welcome to "My Powershell Journey"
My name is Jason "bshaw334" Bradshaw and I'm a systems administrator and I tinker around with web development. Even though I have used Powershell throughout my career I would like to master the scripting and automate some of my everyday tasks.

## I will cover the topics.
- [What is Powershell?](what-is-powershell.md)
- My configurations
- Typical uses
- Basic syntax
- Ways to automate simple tasks
- Active Directory Scripts
- Azure Scripts
- VMware Scripts
