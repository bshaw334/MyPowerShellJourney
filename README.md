# Welcome to "My Powershell Journey"
My name is Jason "bshaw334" Bradshaw and I'm a systems administrator and I tinker around with web development. Even though I have used Powershell throughout my career I would like to master the scripting and automate some of my everyday tasks.

### I will cover the topics.
- [What is Powershell?](what-is-powershell.md)
- [Configurations for desktops](configurations.md)
- [Typical uses](typical-uses.md)
- [Basic syntax](basic-syntax.md)
- [Ways to automate simple tasks](automation.md)
- [Active Directory Scripts](ad-scripts.md)
- [Azure Scripts](azure-scripts.md)
- [VMware Scripts](vmware-scripts.md)
- [My Certification Journey](certifications.md)
